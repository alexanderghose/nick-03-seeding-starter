// * This file is responsible for defining your own model (type) for your data (movie)

// ! A model is a structure for how the data needs to be.
// ! It's something that mongoose requires.
// ! Think of it like defining a REQUIRED typescript interface.
import mongoose from 'mongoose'

// ! Make a schema (structure for the data)
const movieSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  year: { type: Number, required: true },
  image: { type: String, required: true }
})

// ! We export our schema as new model, by using the .model method on mongoose.
// ! VERY IMPORTANT ðŸš¨: First character needs to be uppercase, e.g. Movie
// ! Also recommend not pluralising. 
// ? The second argument is the schema we just made.
export default mongoose.model('Movie', movieSchema)
